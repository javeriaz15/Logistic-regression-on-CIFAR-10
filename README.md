# Convolution Neural Network for Object Recognition on CIFAR-10 Data

## About the Project
**Data:** CIFAR-10 (Training data: 50,000 images; Testing data: 10,000 images)<br >
The classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset of 50,000 training images has been improved in this project. 
## Problem
Improve classification Accuracy
## Solution
This is achieved by the logistic regression model based convolutional neural network with Keras API of TensorFlow for object recognition.
